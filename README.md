# Create React Express App

## Project Description

PlentyofThyme is the newest healthy eating app in the marketplace! Our motto is to go healthy and be happy! Similar to Epicurious, PlentyofThyme is a react-based single-page application which allows users to pin ingredients to their pantry and save receipes that they find interesting, healthy, and unique to help them prepare for their weekly meals. 

xxxx add/edit/delete their own listings, look through other user's listings, like and comment listings and also add to cart and checkout. This application utilizes React components, helper/util functions, and lifecycle methods in order to query and display books based on the user searches. This application uses the full MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack so that users can save items to their cart for later purchase or have the chance to reference and edit their listings later! xxxx

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
