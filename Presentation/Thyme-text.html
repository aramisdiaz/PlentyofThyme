      <p>Episode II</p>
      <h1>Attack of the Final!</h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>A short time ago in a virtual online classroom not so far away...</p>
    
    <p>It is a period of great unrest for the coders of the UCLA Coding online class. After the victory of their second project, they now face their final challenge: Project 3</p>
    <p>With their final project looming, many groups are finishing up their coding, API formatting, and last minute polishing in the hopes that they can secure the final grade necessary to graduate.</p>
    <p>One Group in particular, Group 1, has found themselves almost done with their project, yet disaster looms...</p>
    <p>The members find that they are hungry, which has sapped their ability to code as their energy levels drop. In the midst of hunger one member of Group 1, Aramis Diaz, hatches a desperate plan with his group members, Caroline, Francis, and Eric. He is able to secure the plans for the usage of a Food related API. His hope is that his group can combine healthy eating and an MVP with high polish to graduate.</P>
    
    <p>Yet complications arise. Pursed by scheduling conflicts, differing time zones, and coding errors, Group 1 plots their course to a finished MVP. Will they be able to restore the freedom of their schedules by completeing the program? Or will they be plagued by bugs and line errors? This is their presentation.</p>
